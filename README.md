## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle  
The **TX node** continuously reads heart rate (BPM, Avg BPM), body temperature, and motion/gesture data. This information is transmitted via **UDP** to the **RX node**.  
The **RX node** controls appliances/relays (via LEDs or real relays) and uploads all sensor data to **Blynk Cloud**, where users can monitor health parameters and relay states in real-time.  
Gesture and touch inputs allow hands-free relay control.

## üåü Advantages  
- Real-time **remote health monitoring** through Blynk app  
- **Gesture-based appliance control**, reducing physical interaction  
- Low-power, wireless, and scalable system  
- Compact design with **OLED display feedback** at TX side  
- Can be expanded to **home automation + health monitoring**  

---

## üöÄ Future Scope  
- Integration with **mobile health dashboards** and cloud-based medical records  
- Adding **SpO‚ÇÇ and ECG monitoring** for more complete health analysis  
- Using **AI/ML algorithms** for anomaly detection (e.g., arrhythmia, fever alerts)  
- Voice-assisted or AI-based control for **elderly and differently-abled people**  
- Full integration with **smart home automation ecosystems**
